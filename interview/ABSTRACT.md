## Abstract

In this project you will participate in comprehensive mock interviews conducted in a peer-to-peer format with fellow students. You will learn to articulate technical solutions clearly, handle behavioral questions using structured frameworks, and perform effectively under interview pressure.

Similar to how athletes practice game scenarios to improve performance, software engineers must practice interview scenarios to develop confidence and communication skills that complement their technical abilities.

This project teaches you that successful interviewing requires preparation beyond technical knowledge - you must practice explaining your thought process, handling unexpected questions, and presenting yourself professionally under pressure.
