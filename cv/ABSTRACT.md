## Abstract

Welcome to the final projects of your journey! We know you might be tired, but bear with us. While these projects may seem small and unrelated, without investing your time into them, your efforts in other areas may not pay off.

In this project you will create a professional CV (Curriculum Vitae) specifically tailored for junior software development positions. You will learn to present your technical skills, projects, and experience in a way that appeals to hiring managers and passes through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

A professional CV requires strategic organization of information, highlighting relevant skills, and demonstrating your value proposition to potential employers.

Before writing your CV, you should research the industry standards, understand what recruiters look for, and only then structure your professional story.
